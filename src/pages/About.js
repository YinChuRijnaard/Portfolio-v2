        Hey there, I am Yin Chu 👋🏻
        <br />
        <br />I am a 24 year-old frontend web developer based in Athens, Greece.
        Originally from the Netherlands. Below is a short timeline of what I
        have done before I decided to switch careers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>2021 - today</strong>
        <br />
        In 2021, after I graduated, I started working as a sales agent in Breda
        (North Brabant). It turned out that sales is not really my thing. Later
        that year, in October, I moved to Athens together with my girlfriend. I
        am currently working as a Customer Support Agent at Google (Business
        Profile).
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>2016 - 2021</strong>
        <br />
        In 2016 I started studying International Business for Asia at the
        Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. In 2019, I did a student
        exchange program at Donghua University in Shanghai. Later that year, I
        did an internship at a coding school in Kuala Lumpur. In 2020 I wrote my
        bachelor's thesis at a pharmaceutical company in Rotterdam.
